Discussion
I used the following technologies: Ruby on Rails including advanced forms.

This app is a flight booker. It includes the first three steps of a typical checkout process for booking a one-way flight:

1. Enter desired dates / airports and click “Search”
2. Choose from among a list of eligible flights
3. Enter passenger information for all passengers
4. Enter billing information

A confirmation e-mail is sent out to the passengers.

Requirements
